## **Answer to the questions asked**

1. **Which database you have chosen and why?**

I chose MongoDB due to its:

- Simple hosting and setup.
- JSON-like document storage, which aligns well with the data structure of menus and categories.
- Ability to maintain separate collections while connecting them using IDs.
- Powerful features like field population, which allows fetching related data efficiently when needed.

2. **3 things that you learned from this assignment?**

- How to create a search API 
- Developing a comprehensive Postman documentation for better API usability.
- Implementing regex operations for case-insensitive searching, enhancing flexibility in query handling.

3. **What was the most difficult part of the assignment?**

The most challenging aspect was implementing the tax applicability feature.

It required managing the inheritance of tax values from category to subcategory and eventually to food items, especially when fields were missing during the creation of subcategories or items.

4. **What you would have done differently given more time?**
With additional time, I would have:

- Integrated Multer and Supabase for efficient image storage.
- Developed a frontend panel for easier interaction and management of the system.
- Fully integrated the frontend with the backend to make the solution complete and user-friendly
